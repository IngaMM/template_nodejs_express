Node.js-Express configuration with access to mongodb-database via mongoose

1. Run npm install
2. Run npm run start. Open http://localhost:8000 in a browser.
3. Refresh the page when making changes.
4. Adapt the database-path in .env

Attention:

- This folder must include a file .env (not included in github) with the database-path: DB_CONNECTION=mongodb+srv:...
- Before committing a project to github, create a gitignore file that excludes the folder node_modules and .env
